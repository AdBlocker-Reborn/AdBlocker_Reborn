# AdBlocker Reborned

##Introduction

This is the reborn version of ADBlocker, relying on Xposed Framework to work.

##Development

I am a student majoring in finance, so I don't have so much experience and knowledge in developing.

If you have any issues or want to contribute to the project, feel free to let me know.

##Build

You can find automatic builds based off every commit [here](https://fir.im/8erl), they are certainly untested and may have issues.
