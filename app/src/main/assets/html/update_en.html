<h3>Update Log:</h3>
<pre>
This version implements ZhuGeIO statistics, which is only for user analysis. I will never
sell data to third-party and the code is always open-source. You can disable it by rejecting
giving it phone permissions.

- Remove some unnecessary hooks, should improve performance
- Rework receivers block
- Add count for ads at notification
- Auto hide notifications after 5s
- Introduce ZhuGe statistics (No services or receivers, only for user analysis)
- Squash hosts and blocking rules
